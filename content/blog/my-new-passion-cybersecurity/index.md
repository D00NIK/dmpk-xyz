Yo, didn't post for a while now. This post is just a quick update on my carrier situation.

## New career

A lot has happened in span of a month. If you didn't know, I started studying IT this year, but eventually I wasn't physically able to pass. So I moved over, but this time I started cybersecurity. Why? I researched **a lot** and found out that it's really fun, like **really**.

Moreover, I decided to get a [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity). Currenly, I'm on a third course out of eight. And damn, I love it so far. I learned a lot about breaches and vulnerabilities IT has (but I'm also aware how much I don't know, sadly).

I don't know which path I'll go, whether it be a security/malware analyst or some kind of engineer, I feel I'll find something for me.

So yeah, thanks for reading this, I'll update many things in the near future.
