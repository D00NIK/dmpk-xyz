## Hi!

This is just a quick notice that I've changed my primary domain to **dmpk.xyz**. My old one is still active, although it'll be for only half a year.

## New hosting

For now, I am using a [OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/) web solution. It's pretty neat, you should check it one. For one domain, you get with it:

{{< table >}}
| Advantages                                           | Disadvantages                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| $3 for the first year (.xyz), $13 for the next ones  | only 2 email addresses, one must be postmaster@domain.xyz |
| 100MB web hosting, FTP access, ideal for small blogs |                                                           |
| 5GB for each email address                           |                                                           |
{{</ table >}}


That's what I know for now, I'd say if having 2 email addresses doesn't scare you, then their offer is a good option. That's what you get for almost $1.5 a month, they indeed got me with it.
