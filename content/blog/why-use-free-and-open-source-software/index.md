title: "Why use free and open source software?"

Okay so for a while now I've been using free and open source software. I used to be like everyone, literally born into using Microsoft, Facebook etc. products. All people around me were communicating through Messenger, so did I. But eventually I switched to using Linux and other **good** software. But I still see a majority of my friends and others using these crappy programs. In this article, I want to convince you why you also should stop depending on them.

## For everyone, by everyone

If you're not a technical person, I'll try to explain it to you.

Programs are written by developers and then compiled to machine code, which can be interpreted by a computer and is not readable to humans. This process only really works in one direction. This means that after the compilation, you can't easily guess what it's doing.[^1]

So when you're facing an error in a computer program, if it's proprietary you can try to find a solution online, otherwise just report it to developers and wait for them to fix it (if they'll even try to). There's not much you can do about these big black boxes.

On the other hand, you have open source projects. If someone had faced the same issue as you before, he might have tried to fix it themselves. And that's the beauty. You can easily change the program's behavior. If you're somewhat into coding, you'll most likely understand what's happening under the scene and can change it on your own.

But there's still one problem. Not every open source project is free. And by free I don't mean the price but freedom. This means that you can redistribute it, changed or not. The point is, you can use existing software and create your own on top of it. There are no limits. It's just freedom which makes users create good programs.

Think of free software as a building which can be easily copied and changed to user's likeness. You want to have a wooden house in the woods? No problem. Futuristic hotel overlooking a beach? All it takes is some effort (but still **way** easier than creating something from scratch).

## Trust in corporations

Another aspect is actually being dependent on those big companies. You're giving them sensitive information, and you don't even know what exactly they're doing on **your** computer!

Maybe someday in the future their servers will break and what? You lost all your mails and files to which you should have full access.

Just make yourself independent. You shouldn't trust anyone with your files and have them all on your hard drive. There's just no reason to when you can have all of it and encrypt them if you don't want someone to know about their content.

It's ultimately you who decide what runs on your machine, so you should be more strict about it. On Windows 11 you can't even uninstall Microsoft Edge[^2] (the biggest malware of all)! So yeah, it's maybe not even your hardware...

## They're spying on you![^3]

I hate google. They can recognize every website you enter (which has Google scripts injected), every YouTube video you watch and every place you like going for lunch. Just to... serve you your favorite ads! Everyone loves ads, especially targeted!

But no, I'm totally serious. You've been searching for a phone? Now every website has ads with phones! How nice of them...

### This bullshit doesn't give you a choice

How in shock was I when I was trying to get this Mi Band working for my family member. I opened it up and launched. A QR code popped up which required me to scan it using their app. You can't use it otherwise, how stupid is that?

Just get away from this company. We reached a point where a product assumes you have a smartphone app and are willing to get spied on. Who thought it is a good idea?

I won't be shocked if they'll show you gym ads based on your heartbeat when you started working out.

## It's just better

Why? Because everyone can work on it. Want to fix a bug? Do it and create a pull request. New feature? Do the same.

Another important aspect is security. Everyone can point out and fix a vulnerability.

When all people can cooperate while creating software, of course it'll be higher standards. Not just a bunch of people who doesn't even know how to unit test their app.

It may be hard to use at first but trust me, it'll pay off. Having to type in the terminal might be scary, but that's really how the computer works. All these icons, buttons and boxes are just a replacement to commands.

## Social movement

This one is maybe the most important for some people.

All it is about is having independence, not being forced to use something you don't even know what it's doing, and having a choice. You ultimately want freedom and not being reliable on some shitty company. They're literally selling your data for profits, why even bother using their stuff?

It's literally 1984, but under the hood. They make you feel like they're friendly, but all they're doing is making you dependent on them. Just for money.

So yeah, don't use proprietary software. Let's together build a world of network freedom. Want to know more? Visit [gnu.org/philosophy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html). Every question you might have is answered here.

[^1]: There are methods of finding out what a software is doing. You can try analyzing a software, but at the end you can't be 100% sure. Search for a term "reverse engineering".

[^2]: You actually can, but it's not that easy. That's because Microsoft built their system functionalities relying on Edge, and they don't want you to get rid of it.

[^3]: Of course they aren't admitting it, or they're saying something like: It's for your security, experience bla bla. There have been many incidents of privacy invasion and there will be as long as they're collecting that much data about us.
