### This is my personal blog and sort of portfolio. Here, I'll post my thoughts and tutorials about Cybersecurity, Linux and others.
I just wanted to have a small piece of the internet to myself. There are many things I want to share with others, from basic information about a computer's workflow to lifestyle tips (which are probably common knowledge, but I had to think through them myself).

### But maybe you want to know more about me and my interests.
I'm 19 years old, and I live in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. My journey with computers and tech as a whole started when I was about 8. I always liked to break stuff and find out how it worked and how I could exploit it. Maybe not in a physical way, but I liked automation (mostly for some grinding games).

It all began in sixth grade (11 years old). I moved on from Scratch (lol) to C++. I did some little programs, probably horrible written. It didn't interest me too much, but eventually I learned some scripting languages like Autohotkey and Lua (which were far more useful for me, as I could exploit those horrible minecraft-like grind games). But enough of that, I also learned a bit of Java, C and of course Python.

Then, maybe in 2021, I started learning web development and fell into JavaScript hell. But honestly, it was very, very fun. I now use web knowledge very often, and I think it was unexpectedly (back then) so useful.

From now on, I specialize in web/app security and still like to exploit them. Most often, I use **Python** or Shell, as they can easily do basic tasks. I do not use them for secure apps (as I don't make them) but to automate tasks.

### Anyway, make yourself comfortable. I won't be formal here, so make yourself comfortable.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any complaints.
