### This is my personal blog and sort of portfolio. Here I'll post my thoughts and tutorials about web development and Linux.

The reason behind this website's existence is my lack of boldness. I wanted to improve for a long time, so I pushed myself and created this blog. I've always wanted to share my points and know what others may think about them in greater scale.

### But maybe you want to know more about me and my interests.

I'm 18 (born 2005), currently studying IT and I want to become a web developer. I'm passionate about algorithms and programming in general. I chose the web because it has a lot of different specialties I can become an expert in. As you might've guessed from this site's look and from what you just read, I prefer minimalism, so I went with Linux and started always trying to use as little tools as possible. In the future, I'll may create a special page about my uses.

### Anyway, feel like home. I won't be formal here, so make yourself comfortable. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any complaints.

Note: This site is JS, ads, google, etcetera free. I built it in a matter of performance and privacy. You're not tracked here!
